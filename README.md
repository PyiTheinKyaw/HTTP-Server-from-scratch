# Ou Server

**Developer-Focused HTTP Server in Rust**

**Status:** Under Development

**Purpose:**

- Experimentation and learning with Rust HTTP server development
- Exploration of different request handling techniques

**Current Features:**

- GET
- File Based Server
- Single Thread

**Optimization Considerations:**

- **Request Creation:**
    - **Alternative Methods:** Explore different request constructors provided by the `request` library or other libraries to potentially improve performance or flexibility.
- **Context:**
    - Understanding the specific use cases and code context will guide the most suitable optimization approach.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Implement robust error handling within the `From` implementation or alternative methods to gracefully handle potential request parsing errors.
- **Custom Parsing:**
    - If `From` implementation isn't ideal, consider creating a separate parsing function to process byte slices into `Request` objects for more control.
- **Different HTTP Library:**
    - Evaluate libraries that offer built-in support for byte slice parsing to potentially streamline request handling.

**Contributions and Feedback:**
